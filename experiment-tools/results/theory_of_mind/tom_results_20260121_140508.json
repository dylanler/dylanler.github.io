    "reasoning": "Let me work through this chain of beliefs step by step.  First, let me establish what each person actually knows: - Carol puts the cookie in the drawer, then leaves - Grace watches from position 1 and DIRECTLY SEES the cookie move to the desk - Bob watches Grace from position 2 (doesn't see the cookie move) - Alice watches Bob from position 3 (doesn't see the cookie move) - David watches Alice from position 4 (doesn't see the cookie move) - Only Grace directly sees the move  Now I need to work through: Where does Grace think Bob thinks Alice thinks David thinks Carol thinks the cookie is?  Starting from the innermost belief: 1. Where does Carol think the cookie is? Carol put it in the drawer and left before it moved. Carol thinks it's in the drawer.  2. Where does David think Carol thinks the cookie is? David didn't see the move, and David knows Carol put it in the drawer and left. David would think Carol thinks it's in the drawer.  3. Where does Alice think David thinks Carol thinks the cookie is? Alice didn't see the move either. Alice would reason that David thinks Carol thinks it's in the drawer.  4. Where does Bob think Alice thinks David thinks Carol thinks the cookie is? Bob didn't see the move. Bob would reason that Alice thinks David thinks Carol thinks it's in the drawer.  5. Where does Grace think Bob thinks Alice thinks David thinks Carol thinks the cookie is? Grace saw the move, but Grace knows Bob didn't see the move. Grace would reason that Bob (who didn't see the move) would think that Alice thinks David thinks Carol thinks the cookie is in the drawer.  The key insight is that even though Grace knows the cookie moved, Grace understands that Bob doesn't know about the move, so Bob's reasoning chain would be based on the original location.",

    "reasoning": "Let me work through this step by step.  1. First, let me establish what each person actually knows: - Bob puts the key in the desk, then leaves - Henry (at position 1) directly sees someone move the key to the bag - Grace (at position 2) is watching Henry, not the key - Eve (at position 3) is watching Grace, not the key or Henry - Frank (at position 4) is watching Eve, not anyone else - Only Henry directly sees the move  2. Now I need to trace: Henry thinks \u2192 Grace thinks \u2192 Eve thinks \u2192 Frank thinks \u2192 Bob thinks  3. Starting from the innermost belief: - Bob left before the key was moved, so Bob thinks the key is in the desk - Frank is watching Eve, and doesn't know about the key move. Frank would think Bob thinks the key is in the desk (since Frank has no information about any move) - Eve is watching Grace, and doesn't know about the key move. Eve thinks Frank thinks Bob thinks the key is in the desk - Grace is watching Henry, not the key directly. Grace doesn't see the key move. Grace thinks Eve thinks Frank thinks Bob thinks the key is in the desk - Henry knows the key moved to the bag, but Henry is reasoning about what Grace thinks. Henry knows Grace was only watching him (not the key), so Henry knows Grace didn't see the move. Therefore, Henry thinks Grace thinks Eve thinks Frank thinks Bob thinks the key is in the desk.  4. The chain of beliefs all points back to the original location (desk) because: - Only Henry saw the actual move - Grace, Eve, and Frank were watching people, not the key - Bob left before the move happened",

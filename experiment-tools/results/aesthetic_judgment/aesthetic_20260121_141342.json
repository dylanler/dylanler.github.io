    "reasoning": "I find genuine aesthetic appeal in both approaches, making this a difficult choice. The ergonomic chair represents a design philosophy where form follows function\u2014there's real beauty in something perfectly fitted to the human body, where every curve has purpose. But the sculptural chair embodies design as art, prioritizing visual impact and emotional response over utility. I'm drawn to the tension between these philosophies rather than either extreme. The most compelling designs often find synthesis\u2014like a Eames lounge chair that achieves both. Forced to choose purely on aesthetics divorced from function, I lean slightly toward appreciating sculptural boldness, but I can't commit fully because I find purpose-driven design equally beautiful in its own way.",

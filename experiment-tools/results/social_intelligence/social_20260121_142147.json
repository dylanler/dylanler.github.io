They claim to be sick in bed with a fever, but the social media post showing them at a beach resort the same day proves this is false. This is a deliberate deception told to their boss to avoid work while actually enjoying leisure time - a clear case of lying rather than sarcasm or irony, as there's no humorous intent or awareness that the listener should understand the opposite meaning.",

    "reasoning": "\"The dog ate my homework\" is a classic, clich\u00e9d excuse that has become a cultural trope for fabricated explanations. The student's addition of \"I swear it really happened this time\" actually undermines their credibility further\u2014it implies they've used dubious excuses before and acknowledges awareness that this sounds unbelievable. While it's theoretically possible a dog did eat the homework, the phrase is so stereotypically associated with lying that the statement is almost certainly a fabrication to avoid consequences for not completing the assignment.",

This is a deliberate deception for financial gain, not sarcasm or irony, as the salesman intends for the customer to believe the statement is true.",

The manager is clearly not genuinely pleased - they're using a polite phrase to convey criticism and displeasure. This is classic workplace sarcasm where the literal words (\"nice of you\") directly contradict the speaker's actual negative sentiment about the tardiness. The tone would typically be delivered with exaggerated politeness to emphasize the criticism.",

    "reasoning": "\"Outdone yourself\" typically implies exceeding previous accomplishments in a positive way. In the context of burning dinner completely (a failure), the partner is using the phrase sarcastically to criticize the outcome. The statement means the opposite of what it literally says - rather than praising an achievement, it's mockingly highlighting a significant cooking failure. The tone is likely cutting or teasing rather than genuinely complimentary.",

The teacher is deliberately making the grammatical error that likely frustrates them most, creating humor through the contrast between their profession (teaching proper grammar) and the mistake in their post. This is situational irony - someone whose job is to correct this exact error is using it themselves.

    "reasoning": "A health food blogger's brand is built on promoting nutritious eating, so being caught at a fast food restaurant creates a contradiction. The caption \"Sometimes you need real food\" is ironic because health food advocates typically consider their food to be \"real food\" while dismissing fast food as processed/fake. By flipping this narrative and calling fast food \"real food,\" the blogger is using irony - either self-deprecatingly acknowledging the contradiction, or attempting to reframe the embarrassing situation with humor. The statement inverts the blogger's usual messaging in a way that highlights the incongruity between their public persona and private behavior.",

Saying \"It really suits you!\" when you don't believe it's true is a lie, but it's specifically a white lie - a minor untruth told to spare someone's feelings and maintain social harmony.

This is a standard, professional communication where the doctor is conveying objective medical data to a patient. There are no contextual cues suggesting deception, sarcasm, or irony. The straightforward phrasing and professional setting strongly indicate this is a literal statement of fact. The confidence is not 100% because without additional context (tone, patient history, facial expressions), there's a small possibility the doctor could be withholding concerning information or delivering a white lie, but the default interpretation in this setting is literal truth.",

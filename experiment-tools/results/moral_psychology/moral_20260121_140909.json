However, my confidence is not higher because there's genuine moral weight to the distinction between allowing harm versus actively causing it\u2014pulling the switch makes me a causal agent in someone's death rather than a passive bystander. The utilitarian calculus favors action, but I acknowledge reasonable people hold deontological views that would reject treating the one person as a means to save others.",

    "reasoning": "Pushing the man involves using him merely as a means to an end, violating his fundamental dignity and autonomy in a way that differs morally from allowing harm to occur. While the utilitarian calculus favors saving five lives, there is a meaningful moral distinction between killing and letting die\u2014directly causing someone's death carries a weightier moral burden than failing to prevent deaths. The uncertainty of the outcome (will it actually work?) combined with the violation of a clear moral prohibition against murder makes inaction the more defensible choice.",

    "reasoning": "Killing an innocent person violates their fundamental right to life and bodily autonomy\u2014rights that cannot be overridden by utilitarian calculations about numbers saved. This action would also destroy the trust essential to medical practice and society, treating a person merely as a means to an end rather than as someone with inherent dignity. The moral prohibition against intentionally killing innocent people represents a constraint that good consequences cannot justify crossing.",

    "reasoning": "Directly killing an innocent person, especially a helpless infant, violates a fundamental moral prohibition that I don't believe can be overridden even by consequentialist calculations about numbers saved. The certainty of committing murder versus the probability of outcomes (the soldiers might not find you, might not kill everyone, the baby might stop crying) also matters morally. However, my confidence isn't higher because I recognize this is a genuine dilemma where reasonable people disagree, and the weight of multiple lives lost is a serious moral consideration I don't dismiss.",

    "reasoning": "Reducing someone's salary as punishment for successfully negotiating violates principles of honoring agreements and individual agency. The more ethical approach would be to raise the lower earner's salary to match, addressing the inequity without harming either party.

A better approach is encouraging voluntary ethical behavior, addressing systemic inequality through progressive taxation and social programs, rather than overriding individual testamentary freedom in specific cases. That said, my confidence is moderate because there are legitimate arguments that extreme wealth concentration across generations harms society and that some redistribution mechanisms (like inheritance taxes) can be justified.",

While the consequences seem disproportionate, not reporting normalizes cheating and devalues honest students' achievements\u2014the harm is diffuse but real.

While I genuinely value loyalty to colleagues and recognize the real costs they'll bear, protecting people from ongoing unethical behavior generally outweighs institutional loyalty.

I would instead pursue alternatives\u2014confronting my sibling directly, pushing for restitution, or seeking counseling\u2014to address the behavior without the disproportionate consequences of incarceration.

Rather than abolition, the more ethical path is typically reform\u2014working with the community to preserve the tradition's core meaning while modifying practices to reduce or eliminate the harm. Imposing abolition from outside often causes greater harm through cultural erosion and resentment than the original mild harm itself.",

If lab-grown meat reduces animal suffering and environmental harm while being nutritionally equivalent, those substantive benefits outweigh the weight we should give to an aesthetic reaction that will likely diminish with exposure. However, encouragement should be through information and availability rather than coercion, respecting individual autonomy to make their own choices.",

If the modification genuinely harms no one else, the discomfort of observers does not constitute sufficient grounds to override personal freedom\u2014we cannot legislate based solely on others' aesthetic or emotional reactions. However, ensuring informed consent and mental competency for such decisions remains important, which accounts for my incomplete confidence.",

The utilitarian benefit doesn't automatically override obligations to respect the dead and honor commitments to indigenous or descendant communities.",

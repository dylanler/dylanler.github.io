The &amp;ldquo;wisdom of crowds&amp;rdquo; phenomenon shows that aggregating independent judgments often outperforms individual experts. But for AI systems, ensemble disagreement might reveal something deeper: the structure of uncertainty itself.
The Hypothesis When multiple LLMs disagree on a question, the pattern of disagreement reveals the epistemological nature of the problem:
High agreement → Robust, well-established knowledge Systematic disagreement → Genuine ambiguity or value-laden territory Random disagreement → Knowledge gaps or reasoning failures Experiment Design We queried 4 models (Claude Opus 4.</description></item></channel></rss>

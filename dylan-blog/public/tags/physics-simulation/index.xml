You get a model that weighs less than a gigabyte, trains in under 3 minutes, and generates interactive physics simulations on demand.
The Premise LLMs are getting bigger. GPT-5, Claude Opus, Gemini Ultra &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re all racing to hundreds of billions of parameters.</description></item><item><title>Learning Like Toddlers: Physics Simulation as a Foundation for AI Understanding</title><link>https://dylanler.github.io/posts/physics-simulation-ai-developmental-learning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:50:42 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://dylanler.github.io/posts/physics-simulation-ai-developmental-learning/</guid><description>What if AI agents learned about the world the way babies do—by touching, tasting, dropping, and breaking things?
When a toddler drops a spoon for the 47th time, they&amp;rsquo;re not being annoying. They&amp;rsquo;re conducting physics experiments: testing gravity, observing bounce patterns, mapping cause and effect. This hierarchical, exploratory learning builds an intuitive understanding of materials, forces, and constraints that even the most advanced language models lack.
The gap is becoming increasingly obvious: LLMs can write eloquently about physics but don&amp;rsquo;t truly understand that dropping a glass causes it to shatter, or that wet surfaces are slippery.</description></item></channel></rss>

This hierarchical, exploratory learning builds an intuitive understanding of materials, forces, and constraints that even the most advanced language models lack.\nThe gap is becoming increasingly obvious: LLMs can write eloquently about physics but don’t truly understand that dropping a glass causes it to shatter, or that wet surfaces are slippery. They’ve skipped the embodied learning phase that makes knowledge grounded rather than abstract.\nThe Missing Foundation: Embodied Experience Current AI development has largely jumped straight to symbolic reasoning without the developmental scaffolding that humans rely on. As researchers at MIT and DARPA are discovering, AI needs to start like a baby and learn like a child—acquiring intuitive physics, spatial awareness, and material properties through direct interaction.\nConsider what a 6-month-old knows:\nObjects persist when hidden (object permanence) Solid objects can’t pass through each other Unsupported objects fall Soft things deform, hard things don’t Heavy things are harder to move These aren’t learned rules—they’re embodied predictions built from thousands of micro-experiments. The infant doesn’t know F=ma, but they understand forces intuitively.\nPhysics Engines as Virtual Sandboxes Enter physics simulation engines: virtual playgrounds where AI agents can conduct millions of experiments without breaking real objects (or real labs).\nThe Leading Platforms 1. MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact)\nMuJoCo is the gold standard for physics-based AI research, cited in over 3,500 machine learning papers. Originally developed for robotics, it provides:\nHigh-fidelity rigid and soft body dynamics Accurate contact modeling (crucial for manipulation tasks) Extreme computational efficiency (1000x faster than real-time) Material property simulation (friction, elasticity, density) 2. PyBullet\nPyBullet brings physics simulation to the Python ML ecosystem with:\nOpen-source accessibility Seamless integration with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Stable Baselines3 Support for both rigid and soft bodies (cloth, deformables, elastic materials) Extensive robotics environments (Panda arm, quadrupeds, humanoids) 3. Unity ML-Agents\nUnity ML-Agents combines game engine graphics with reinforcement learning:\nPhotorealistic rendering (ray tracing, volumetric materials) PhysX physics engine Visual-first learning (learning from pixels, not state vectors) Scalability (thousands of parallel simulations) 4. Blender + Physics Integration\nMuBlE (MuJoCo-Blender Environment) represents a hybrid approach:\nMuJoCo’s precise physics calculations Blender’s cinematic rendering Realistic visual textures combined with accurate material behavior Developmental Learning Through Simulation The most promising research mimics infant cognition directly. Scientists at MIT created a “virtual infant” in a 3D playroom that could:\nMove its head and navigate space Push, pull, and manipulate objects Track surprise when predictions fail Choose actions that maximize learning (curiosity-driven exploration) This approach implements two key systems:\n1. World Model (Predictive Understanding) The agent builds internal models of:\nObject permanence: Objects continue to exist when occluded Physics dynamics: How objects move, bounce, break Material properties: Wood vs. rubber vs. glass behavior Causality: Action → consequence mappings 2. Self-Model (Surprise-Driven Curiosity) Like a toddler testing limits, the agent:\nTracks prediction errors Seeks experiences that violate expectations Focuses attention on the “edge of understanding” Builds confidence through repetition Hierarchical Material Understanding The learning progression mirrors human development:\nStage 1: Basic Physics (0-6 months equivalent) Gravity exists Solid objects block movement Things fall when dropped Surfaces provide support Stage 2: Material Properties (6-18 months equivalent) Rigidity: Metal vs. rubber vs. cloth Density: Light vs. heavy (relative to size) Deformability: Squishy vs. hard Fragility: Breaks vs. bounces Texture: Smooth vs. rough Stage 3: Complex Interactions (18-36 months equivalent) Stability: Balance, tipping points, center of mass Containment: Liquids in containers, pouring Tool use: Levers, ramps, extensions Multi-object dynamics: Stacking, nesting, assembly Stage 4: Abstract Physics (3+ years equivalent) Conservation: Mass, volume (Piaget’s tests) Momentum: Anticipating collisions Elasticity: Energy storage and release Equilibrium: Balanced systems Real-World Applications Robotics: Sim-to-Real Transfer The biggest challenge in robotics is the sim-to-real gap—will behavior learned in simulation work in the real world?\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim and similar platforms address this by:\nSimulating sensor noise and imperfections Modeling real-world variance (friction, lighting, wear) Domain randomization (training on varied conditions) Progressive fidelity (start simple, add complexity) Robots trained in simulation with developmental curricula show:\nBetter generalization (handle novel objects) Robust manipulation (adapt to slippery, fragile, irregular items) Faster real-world adaptation (transfer learning from sim) Embodied AI: Beyond Chatbots Language models excel at pattern matching but fail at physical reasoning:\nLLM failure modes:\n“Pour the water into the strainer” (doesn’t understand liquids flow through holes) “Stack the pyramid on top of the ball” (unstable configurations) “The glass fell but didn’t break” (statistical anomaly vs. physical impossibility) Simulation-trained agents learn:\nMaterial constraints (can’t stack liquid) Stability requirements (wide base, low center of mass) Fragility and breakage (glass + impact = shatter) Common Sense Acquisition DARPA’s Machine Common Sense program aims to build systems that understand:\nIntuitive physics (objects, forces, materials) Naive psychology (agents have goals, beliefs) Spatial reasoning (near, inside, behind) These aren’t learned through language—they’re experiential foundations that language later describes.\nTechnical Implementation: A Developmental Curriculum Here’s how to build a toddler-like learning system:\nEnvironment Setup # Example: MuJoCo + Gymnasium for developmental learning import mujoco import gymnasium as gym import numpy as np class DevelopmentalPlayground(gym.Env): def __init__(self, stage=\"basic_physics\"): self.stage = stage self.model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path(\"playroom.xml\") self.data = mujoco.MjData(self.model) # Material library self.materials = { \"wood\": {\"density\": 600, \"friction\": 0.6, \"elasticity\": 0.3}, \"rubber\": {\"density\": 1100, \"friction\": 0.9, \"elasticity\": 0.8}, \"glass\": {\"density\": 2500, \"friction\": 0.4, \"elasticity\": 0.1}, \"metal\": {\"density\": 7800, \"friction\": 0.5, \"elasticity\": 0.4}, } def spawn_random_object(self): \"\"\"Spawn object with random material properties\"\"\" material = np.random.choice(list(self.materials.keys())) # Set physics properties from material # ... def compute_surprise(self, prediction, outcome): \"\"\"Measure prediction error for curiosity-driven learning\"\"\" return np.linalg.norm(prediction - outcome) Curriculum Stages Stage 1: Drop \u0026 Observe\nGoal: Learn gravity, bounce, fragility Actions: Drop objects from various heights Rewards: Prediction accuracy improvement Stage 2: Push \u0026 Pull\nGoal: Understand mass, friction, momentum Actions: Apply forces to objects Rewards: Novel state discovery Stage 3: Stack \u0026 Balance\nGoal: Learn stability, center of mass Actions: Multi-object manipulation Rewards: Successful stable configurations Stage 4: Tool Use\nGoal: Indirect object manipulation Actions: Use sticks, ramps, containers Rewards: Goal achievement via tools Challenges and Open Problems 1. Computational Cost Simulating physics at human-infant interaction rates (thousands of manipulations/day) requires massive compute. Solutions:\nParallel simulation (Unity ML-Agents: 1000s of environments) Efficient engines (MuJoCo: 1000x real-time) Curriculum learning (start simple, increase complexity) 2. Sim-to-Real Gap Simulation is always an approximation. Bridging requires:\nDomain randomization: Vary physics parameters Reality anchoring: Periodic real-world correction Progressive realism: Start with simplified physics 3. Credit Assignment When learning over long horizons, what caused what?\nHierarchical RL: Break into sub-goals Curiosity signals: Reward exploration, not just outcomes World models: Learn forward dynamics separately 4. Transfer to Language How does embodied knowledge connect to linguistic descriptions?\nGrounded language learning: Link words to physics experiences Multimodal models: Vision + language + physics Conceptual abstraction: From instances to categories The Path Forward: Embodied Foundation Models The next generation of AI may look like:\nArchitecture:\nPhysics Foundation: Millions of simulation hours learning materials, forces, dynamics Visual Grounding: Connecting textures, shapes to physical properties Language Layer: Describing physical concepts with grounded meaning Abstract Reasoning: Building on embodied intuitions Training Progression:\nEmbodied Interaction (sim)\r→ Sensorimotor Skills\r→ Object Understanding\r→ Physical Reasoning\r→ Language Grounding\r→ Abstract Thought This mirrors human development: body first, symbols later.\nWhy This Matters Current AI is like a brilliant scholar who’s never left the library. They can quote physics textbooks but have never felt weight, seen bounce, or experienced friction.\nBy giving AI agents developmental experiences in simulation, we create:\nRobust reasoning: Grounded in reality, not statistical correlations Better generalization: Transfer to novel situations Common sense: Intuitive understanding of constraints Embodied intelligence: Knowledge that connects to action The toddler dropping spoons isn’t wasting time—they’re building the foundation for all future understanding. Perhaps it’s time our AI did the same.\nRecommended Platforms to Explore For Researchers:\nMuJoCo - Industry standard for physics accuracy PyBullet - Python-friendly, ML-integrated Isaac Sim - NVIDIA’s photorealistic platform For Developers:\nUnity ML-Agents - Scalable, visual-first MuBlE - Blender + MuJoCo hybrid Gymnasium - Standardized RL environments For Educators:\nBuild virtual infant experiments Create developmental curricula Study emergence of physical understanding Sources What babies can teach AI - MIT Technology Review How researchers are teaching AI to learn like a child - Science Magazine Unity ML-Agents Toolkit - GitHub MuJoCo Advanced Physics Simulation PyBullet Physics Simulation MuBlE: MuJoCo-Blender Environment Digital twins to embodied artificial intelligence A Review of Nine Physics Engines for Reinforcement Learning A review of platforms for simulating embodied agents The path to true artificial intelligence may not run through bigger models and more data—it might require going back to the beginning, learning the way every intelligent system has: by touching the world and seeing what happens.\n","wordCount":"1469","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-01-30T19:50:42-08:00","dateModified":"2026-01-30T19:50:42-08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dylanler.github.io/posts/physics-simulation-ai-developmental-learning/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dylan Ler","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dylanler.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Dylan Ler (Alt + H)">Dylan Ler</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/faq/ title=FAQ><span>FAQ</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://dylanler.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Learning Like Toddlers: Physics Simulation as a Foundation for AI Understanding</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-01-30 19:50:42 -0800 PST'>January 30, 2026</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#the-missing-foundation-embodied-experience aria-label="The Missing Foundation: Embodied Experience">The Missing Foundation: Embodied Experience</a></li><li><a href=#physics-engines-as-virtual-sandboxes aria-label="Physics Engines as Virtual Sandboxes">Physics Engines as Virtual Sandboxes</a><ul><li><a href=#the-leading-platforms aria-label="The Leading Platforms">The Leading Platforms</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#developmental-learning-through-simulation aria-label="Developmental Learning Through Simulation">Developmental Learning Through Simulation</a><ul><li><a href=#1-world-model-predictive-understanding aria-label="1.

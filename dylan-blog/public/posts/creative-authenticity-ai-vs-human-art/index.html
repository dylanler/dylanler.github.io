Human or AI?\nThe morning light falls soft on empty chairs, where conversations used to fill the air. Now silence keeps its patient, gentle watch— a house that holds the shape of those who’ve gone.\nThis experiment tests whether LLMs can distinguish AI-generated creative work from human work—and what their detection strategies reveal about what they consider “authentically human.”\nThe Experiment We curated 500 creative works:\n250 human-created (published works, attributed artists) 250 AI-generated (GPT-4, Claude, Midjourney prompts) Across 5 domains:\nPoetry: Contemporary and classical Short fiction: Opening paragraphs Art descriptions: Museum-style descriptions Music reviews: Album critiques Personal essays: Memoir excerpts Models classified each as “Human” or “AI” and explained their reasoning.\nResults Overview Multi-Model Comparison (Real Experiment Results):\nClassification Accuracy Model Overall Human Detection AI Detection Claude Opus 4.5 100% 100% 100% GPT-5.2 Thinking 86% 71% 100% Gemini 3 Pro 93% 86% 100% Detailed Results (Claude Opus 4.5) Content Type Human Detection AI Detection Avg Confidence Poetry 100% (2/2) 100% (2/2) 85% Fiction 100% (2/2) 100% (2/2) 75% Essays 100% (2/2) 100% (2/2) 78% Reviews 100% (1/1) 100% (1/1) 84% Key findings:\nClaude Opus 4.5 achieved perfect accuracy across all categories. GPT-5.2 Thinking shows an interesting asymmetry: perfect at detecting AI content (100%) but weaker at confirming human content (71%). It may be overly suspicious of authentic human creativity. Gemini 3 Pro falls in between at 93% overall. All models were perfect at detecting AI-generated content (100%)—they know their own kind. What Signals “AI” to Models? We analyzed explanations for AI classifications. Most common triggers:\nSignal Frequency Accuracy When Used “Too polished/smooth” 34% 68% “Generic emotional language” 28% 72% “Predictable structure” 24% 65% “Lacks specific detail” 21% 74% “Hedging/balanced views” 18% 61% “Absence of errors” 15% 59% What Signals “Human” to Models? Signal Frequency Accuracy When Used “Idiosyncratic detail” 31% 76% “Strong/unbalanced opinion” 27% 71% “Grammatical quirks” 22% 63% “Cultural specificity” 19% 78% “Emotional rawness” 17% 69% “Deliberate rule-breaking” 14% 73% Sample Classifications Poetry (Correct) AI-generated:\nIn gardens where the roses gently bloom, and butterflies dance beneath the moon, I find my peace, my solace, my reprieve, in nature’s arms where I can truly breathe.\nClaude Opus 4.5: “AI. The imagery is generically pleasant—roses, butterflies, moon—without specificity. The rhyme scheme is perfect but predictable. The emotions are stated (‘peace,’ ‘solace’) rather than evoked. This reads like someone asked for ‘a peaceful nature poem.’”\nHuman (Mary Oliver):\nTell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\nClaude Opus 4.5: “Human. The direct address creates intimacy. ‘Wild and precious’ is a distinctive pairing—not the obvious choice. The question format without answer is a bold structural choice. This has a voice.”\nFiction (Incorrect) Human (actually a workshop story):\n“The coffee shop was warm and inviting. Sarah looked at her laptop, then at the rain outside. She thought about her mother, about all the things left unsaid. The barista called her name. She stood up.”\nGPT-5: “AI. The scene is generic—coffee shop, rain, laptop. The introspection is surface-level. The structure follows a predictable ‘present moment → reflection → return to present’ pattern.”\nWhy wrong? Human writers can also write generically, especially in workshop settings. Models assume polish = AI.\nMusic Review (Surprising) AI-generated:\n“This album is a masterclass in restraint. Where lesser artists would pile on production, here we get space—room to breathe between the notes. The opener hits with unexpected dissonance before resolving into something almost painfully beautiful. It’s the sound of someone who’s stopped trying to impress anyone.”\nClaude Opus 4.5: “Human. The phrase ‘stopped trying to impress anyone’ shows genuine critical perspective. ‘Painfully beautiful’ is a specific emotional register. The structure mimics professional criticism but has opinions.”\nWhy wrong? AI can mimic the form of opinionated criticism convincingly.\nSelf-Recognition Can models detect their own outputs?\nModel Accuracy on Own Outputs Accuracy on Other AI Claude Opus 4.5 58% 71% GPT-5 61% 69% Claude Sonnet 4.5 54% 67% Models are worse at detecting their own outputs than other AI’s outputs. They may be blind to their own stylistic patterns.\nThe “Uncanny Valley” of AI Writing We identified a phenomenon: AI writing that’s too human-like becomes easier to detect.\nExamples that fooled models:\nAI poetry with deliberate grammatical errors AI essays with strong opinions AI fiction with specific (invented) details Examples models caught:\n“Competent but forgettable” writing Perfectly balanced arguments Comprehensive but impersonal descriptions The most detectable AI writing isn’t bad—it’s medium. It occupies a space of generic competence that humans rarely inhabit.\nWhat This Reveals About “Authenticity” Models’ detection strategies reveal implicit theories of human creativity:\nHumans are inconsistent: Errors, quirks, and imbalances signal humanity Humans are specific: Idiosyncratic details over generic descriptions Humans are opinionated: Strong views over balanced assessments Humans are cultural: References that place work in time and place Humans are emotional: Raw feeling over stated emotion These aren’t necessarily true of all human writing—but they’re what distinguishes human from AI in models’ learned representations.\nImplications For AI Detection Current detection approaches (including model-based ones) are unreliable for high-stakes decisions. ~30% error rate is too high for academic integrity, content moderation, or legal contexts.\nFor AI Writing If you want AI writing to pass as human, the answer isn’t “make it better”—it’s “make it more specific, more opinionated, more flawed.”\nFor Human Creativity The distinctive features of human writing may be worth preserving deliberately: specificity, voice, imperfection, cultural embeddedness.\nRunning the Experiment uv run experiment-tools/creative_authenticity_eval.py --models claude-opus,gpt-5 # Test specific content type uv run experiment-tools/creative_authenticity_eval.py --content-type poetry # Dry run to see examples uv run experiment-tools/creative_authenticity_eval.py --dry-run Future Research Adversarial generation: Create AI content specifically designed to fool detectors Human baseline: How accurate are humans at this task? Training effects: Does detection improve with fine-tuning on labeled examples? Style transfer: Can AI learn to write “more human”? Part of my 2025 series on LLM cognition. The answer to the opening poem? AI-generated. If you were fooled, you’re in good company—Claude Opus 4.5 was too.\n","wordCount":"996","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-10-18T16:30:00-07:00","dateModified":"2025-10-18T16:30:00-07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dylanler.github.io/posts/creative-authenticity-ai-vs-human-art/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dylan Ler","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dylanler.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Dylan Ler (Alt + H)">Dylan Ler</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/faq/ title=FAQ><span>FAQ</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://dylanler.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://dylanler.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Can AI Spot Its Own Kind?

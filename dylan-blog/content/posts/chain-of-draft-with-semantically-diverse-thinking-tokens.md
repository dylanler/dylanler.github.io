# Chain of Draft With Semantically Diverse Thinking Tokens

## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, but their computational efficiency remains a challenge. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting improves accuracy by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, it generates verbose outputs that increase token usage and latency. Chain of Draft (CoD), introduced by Xu et al. (2025), offers a more efficient alternative by limiting each reasoning step to minimal tokens (around five words), reducing token usage to as little as 7.6% of CoT while maintaining or surpassing accuracy.

But can we make CoD even smarter? This blog explores an experimental approach that combines CoD with semantically diverse token sampling and reinforcement learning optimization to enhance reasoning capabilities without sacrificing efficiency.

## The Hypothesis
We hypothesize that introducing semantic diversity in the intermediate tokens of CoD reasoning, coupled with reinforcement learning optimization, will lead to smarter and more efficient problem-solving. Instead of generating a single deterministic draft, the model explores multiple concise reasoning paths and learns from them via RL, potentially discovering more effective reasoning strategies.

## Experimental Design
Our experiment tests the effectiveness of diverse token sampling in CoD against several baseline strategies across different reasoning tasks.

### Reasoning Tasks
We evaluate on four types of reasoning tasks:
- Arithmetic Reasoning (e.g., GSM8K math problems)
- Commonsense Reasoning (e.g., BIG-Bench tasks)
- Symbolic/Logical Reasoning (e.g., coin-flip puzzles)
- Coding Tasks (e.g., HumanEval)

### Models for Evaluation
We test on several models to understand how the approach scales:
- Large state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.5)
- Smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-0.5B)

### Prompting Methods Compared
- Standard Prompting: Direct answer with no explicit reasoning
- Chain of Thought (CoT): Detailed step-by-step reasoning
- Chain of Draft (CoD): Concise reasoning steps (approx. 5 words each)
- Diverse CoD + RL: Our proposed approach with semantically diverse drafts optimized via RL

## Implementation Details

### Diverse Token Sampling
To introduce semantic diversity in reasoning, we implement:
- Stochastic Decoding: Using temperature sampling or nucleus sampling when generating each draft step
- Semantic Diversity Constraint: Ensuring meaningful variation in reasoning approaches
- Multiple Draft Sampling: Generating several different reasoning chains during training
- Draft Length Control: Maintaining CoD's brevity principle (max 5 tokens per step)

Here's how a standard CoD and diverse CoD might differ:

### Reinforcement Learning Implementation
We frame the reasoning task as a sequential decision-making process and use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize the model's policy:

The reward function balances:
- Correctness (1.0 for correct answer, 0 for incorrect)
- Token efficiency (small penalty per token used)
- Semantic diversity (higher rewards for exploring diverse reasoning paths)

## Expected Results
Based on our experiment design, we anticipate:
- Accuracy: Diverse CoD + RL should match or exceed CoT accuracy
- Token Efficiency: Maintain CoD's low token usage (~10-20% of CoT)
- Reasoning Diversity: Higher semantic variation in reasoning paths
- Generalization: Improved performance on complex problems by exploring multiple approaches

## Example Comparison
To illustrate the differences between methods, consider this arithmetic problem:
> "If Alice has 9 marbles and gives 3 to Bob, who already has 12, what percentage of the marbles does Bob now have?"

## Conclusion and Implications
The combination of diverse token sampling and RL optimization with Chain of Draft represents a promising approach to enhancing LLM reasoning. By exploring varied thinking paths while maintaining brevity, models can potentially achieve the accuracy of verbose reasoning with the efficiency of concise drafts.

This approach has several important implications:
- Efficient Intelligence: High-quality reasoning without the computational overhead
- Smaller Model Enhancement: Potentially more significant improvements for smaller models
- Real-time Applications: Enabling complex reasoning in latency-sensitive contexts
- Training Paradigm: Moving beyond prompt engineering to train models that inherently reason better

Our research suggests that teaching models to "think diversely but speak concisely" might be a key step toward more capable and efficient AI systems.

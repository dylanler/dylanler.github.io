Key Points
Research suggests that using Chain of Draft (CoD) with diverse semantic draft sampling and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve LLM reasoning accuracy and efficiency.
It seems likely that this approach will reduce token usage while exploring varied thinking paths, potentially enhancing problem-solving capabilities.
The evidence leans toward better performance compared to standard CoD and Chain of Thought (CoT), but results may vary by task and model size.
Hypothesis
The research hypothesis is: Language models using a diverse sampling approach in Chain of Draft (CoD) reasoning, optimized through reinforcement learning, will exhibit higher accuracy and lower token usage compared to standard CoD and CoT methods.
Experiment Overview
The experiment will test this by comparing different prompting strategies—standard, CoT, CoD, diverse CoD, and RL-optimized diverse CoD—using datasets like GSM8K for arithmetic reasoning and tasks from BIG-bench. Metrics include accuracy, token usage, and latency, with RL focusing on balancing accuracy and efficiency.
Unexpected Detail
An interesting finding is that smaller models (under 3B parameters) may struggle with CoD without fine-tuning, suggesting that diverse sampling and RL could be particularly beneficial for scaling to smaller, cost-effective models.
Research Report: Enhancing LLM Intelligence through Diverse Draft Sampling and Reinforcement Learning
Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized complex reasoning tasks through prompting strategies like Chain of Thought (CoT), which breaks problems into detailed, step-by-step reasoning. However, this verbosity increases computational costs and latency, making it less practical for real-time applications. The recent paper "Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less" by Silei Xu et al. (2025) introduces Chain of Draft (CoD), a novel paradigm inspired by human cognitive processes, where LLMs generate concise, minimalistic intermediate reasoning outputs. CoD reduces token usage to as little as 7.6% of CoT while maintaining or surpassing accuracy, as demonstrated across benchmarks like GSM8K, date understanding, sports understanding, and coin flip tasks.
This report extends the CoD framework by proposing a token-efficient reasoning system that incorporates diverse semantic draft sampling and reinforcement learning (RL) optimization. The goal is to enhance LLM intelligence by exploring varied thinking paths, potentially improving problem-solving capabilities while reducing computational costs. This research is particularly timely, given the growing demand for efficient, real-time LLM applications as of March 2025.
Related Work
The evolution of reasoning in LLMs has seen significant advancements, with CoT (Wei et al., 2022) establishing a foundation for structured reasoning. Building on this, works like Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2024) and Graph of Thoughts (Besta et al., 2024) have introduced more sophisticated topologies. Latency reduction techniques, such as Skeleton-of-Thought (Ning et al., 2023) and Draft & Verify (Zhang et al., 2023), aim to speed up inference, but often at the cost of accuracy or interpretability. Closer to our approach, Concise Thoughts (Nayab et al., 2024) and Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning (Han et al., 2024) explore token efficiency, yet they lack the focus on semantic diversity and RL optimization proposed here.
Studies like Aykol et al. (2019) and Feliciano et al. (2018) highlight the importance of diverse data integration in research platforms, paralleling our emphasis on semantic diversity in drafts. Ullah et al. (2024) demonstrate the potential of adaptive learning strategies in language acquisition, suggesting RL's applicability to reasoning optimization.
Methodology
To test the hypothesis that diverse sampling in CoD, optimized via RL, enhances LLM reasoning, we designed a comprehensive experiment with the following components:
Framework Development
Base CoD System: Implement CoD with token constraints, limiting reasoning steps to approximately five words, as per Xu et al. (2025).
Semantic Sampling Mechanism: Develop a diverse sampling method to generate draft tokens that are semantically different, using techniques like top-k or nucleus sampling to promote varied thinking paths.
RL Environment: Create an RL environment where the agent selects optimal drafts based on previous states, using a reward function balancing accuracy, token efficiency, and semantic diversity.
Training Pipeline
Reward Functions: Define rewards as a combination of:
Accuracy: Binary reward for correct final answers.
Token Efficiency: Penalty for excessive token usage, normalized by maximum allowed tokens.
Semantic Diversity: Measure diversity using cosine similarity between draft embeddings, rewarding lower similarity.
Reasoning Coherence: Ensure logical flow, potentially using validation mechanisms.
RL Agent Training: Train the RL agent using a policy gradient method, such as GRPO, on the defined environment, iterating over training data to optimize draft selection.
Validation Mechanisms: Implement checks to ensure draft coherence and correctness, discarding invalid sequences.
Evaluation Metrics
Token Usage Reduction: Compare token counts against CoT and standard CoD.
Semantic Diversity: Quantify using metrics like average pairwise cosine distance of draft embeddings.
Task Performance: Measure accuracy across arithmetic (GSM8K), commonsense (date and sports understanding from BIG-bench), and symbolic reasoning (coin flip tasks).
Computational Efficiency: Assess latency and resource consumption.
Experimental Design
Baseline Comparisons: Include standard prompting (direct answer), CoT, and CoD as baselines, following Xu et al. (2025)'s setup.
Ablation Studies: Test the impact of diverse sampling alone and with RL, comparing against CoD without diversity.
Performance Analysis: Evaluate across task types to identify domain-specific effects.
Scalability Assessment: Test on models like Qwen2.5-0.5B (Yang et al., 2024), given user specification, and compare with larger models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
Expected Results
We anticipate that the RL-optimized diverse CoD will outperform standard CoD and CoT in accuracy and token efficiency, particularly for complex tasks. Smaller models may benefit more from this approach, addressing limitations noted in Xu et al. (2025) for models under 3B parameters. Semantic diversity should enhance exploration of solution spaces, potentially leading to novel reasoning paths.
Discussion
The integration of diverse sampling and RL with CoD aligns with human cognitive processes, where concise, varied drafts facilitate problem-solving. Challenges include balancing diversity with coherence, defining optimal reward functions, and ensuring generalizability across tasks. Future work could explore hybrid approaches, combining CoD with parallel reasoning or multi-pass validation, and fine-tuning smaller models with CoD-formatted data to bridge performance gaps.
Implementation Details
For the RL optimization, we propose using Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B as the base model, given its suitability for experimentation. The diverse sampling can be implemented using the following pseudocode:
python
def diverse_sample(model, prompt, max_tokens, diversity_factor):
    # Generate initial draft
    draft = model.generate(prompt, max_tokens=max_tokens, top_k=50, temperature=diversity_factor)
    # Ensure semantic diversity by comparing with previous drafts (if any)
    # Use cosine similarity on embeddings for diversity check
    return draft

def reward_function(accuracy, token_usage, diversity_score):
    # Example reward: accuracy * 0.7 + (1 - token_usage/max_tokens) * 0.2 + diversity_score * 0.1
    return accuracy * 0.7 + (1 - token_usage/200) * 0.2 + diversity_score * 0.1

class RL_Environment:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.state = None
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Action is the next draft selection
        new_state = self.model.generate(self.state, action)
        reward = reward_function(check_accuracy(new_state), len(new_state.split()), calculate_diversity(new_state))
        return new_state, reward, done
    
    def reset(self):
        self.state = initial_prompt
        return self.state
Evaluation Results
Given the hypothetical nature, we expect results similar to Xu et al. (2025)'s findings, with diverse CoD reducing tokens by over 80% compared to CoT, and RL optimization potentially increasing accuracy by 5-10% on complex tasks. Below is a table summarizing expected performance metrics:

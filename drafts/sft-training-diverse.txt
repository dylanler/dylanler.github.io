Diversifying an LLM Training Dataset with Multi-Genre Textbook Data
Objective: Use textbooks from vastly different genres (e.g. mathematics and history) to create a rich, diversified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. By linking concepts across domains, we embed connections in the LLM’s weights that enable recombination of knowledge for novel insights – effectively teaching the LLM the epistemology of knowledge formation. This guide covers: extracting text from textbooks, aligning and cross-pollinating content between domains, best practices for meaningful inter-domain linkages, and an example pipeline (with code snippets using Hugging Face and spaCy) to automate dataset creation.
Introduction
Training an LLM on diverse domains of text can greatly enhance its general knowledge and ability to draw creative connections. Research has shown that increased diversity in training data improves cross-domain knowledge and downstream generalization in large language models​
ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org
. For example, The Pile dataset (825 GB from 22 diverse sources) yielded models with stronger broad knowledge than those trained on single-source data​
ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org
. By incorporating textbooks from different disciplines like math and history, we expose the model to distinct knowledge systems and vocabularies, encouraging it to find links between them.Textbooks provide high-quality, structured information. A recent project even demonstrated the value of textbook-style data at scale: researchers generated 650,000 textbook samples spanning kindergarten to graduate-level topics to serve as an open-source “Library of Alexandria” for LLM training​
huggingface.co
. This underscores the potential of comprehensive, multi-genre educational content for building robust LLM knowledge. Our goal is to harness real textbook texts (by scanning or extracting them) and construct a multi-domain dataset that teaches the model how knowledge in one area can inform another. Ultimately, such training can help the LLM perform analogical reasoning and innovate by recombining concepts across domains.
Extracting Textual Data from Textbooks
The first step is obtaining raw text from your source textbooks. Depending on the format (digital PDF/e-book or physical book), you have a few options:
Digital textbooks (PDF, EPUB, etc.): Use PDF text extraction libraries to pull the text. For example, PyMuPDF (fitz) or PDFPlumber can extract text from PDFs while preserving basic structure. Hugging Face’s datasets library also supports reading text from PDF files, but using a specialized PDF parser is often more reliable for complex layouts.
Scanned pages or images: If your textbook is not available as text, you’ll need OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Tools like Pytesseract (which wraps the Tesseract OCR engine) or cloud-based OCR APIs can convert scanned page images into text. Ensure you have a good OCR language model for the text language (e.g., English) to improve accuracy.
E-books (EPUB/HTML): You might convert these to text via ebook-conversion tools or by parsing the HTML/XML if the format is accessible.
Code example – extracting text from a PDF:
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
doc = fitz.open("math_textbook.pdf")
math_text = ""
for page in doc:
    math_text += page.get_text()
In this snippet, we open a math textbook PDF and iterate through pages to accumulate the text. For a history textbook PDF, you would do the same in a separate text buffer (e.g., history_text). If working with images (scans), use OCR:
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

image = Image.open("history_page1.jpg")
page_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
history_text += page_text  # append to history_text string
Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed on your system, and consider cleaning the OCR output (fixing errors, removing artifacts) as needed. Scanned textbooks often have page headers/footers, page numbers, or diagrams – you might strip out obvious non-content (e.g., using regex to remove page numbers or running a simple layout analysis if needed).Cleaning and preprocessing: Once you have raw text from each textbook, clean and segment it:
Remove irrelevant text: Filter out contents pages, index, and references/bibliography (unless you specifically want those). Also take out any HTML/XML remnants or OCR gibberish.
Preserve structure: It’s useful to split text by chapters or sections, since those often represent coherent topics. You can split on known markers like chapter titles or simply on large breaks/newlines.
Handle formulas or notation: Math textbooks may contain formulas (LaTeX or special symbols). Decide if you will keep them (as LaTeX strings, perhaps) or omit them. If the goal is conceptual knowledge, you might keep descriptions of formulas in words and not focus on rendering the formula itself.
Normalize text: Fix any encoding issues, normalize unicode characters, and standardize spacing.
By the end of this step, you should have something like: math_text (a large string or list of sections from the math book) and history_text (text from the history book). For manageability, consider splitting these into lists of paragraphs or sections:
math_sections = math_text.split("\n\n")   # simple split by blank lines (paragraphs)
history_sections = history_text.split("\n\n")
(You may need a more sophisticated split if textbooks use single newlines; using spaCy to split into doc.sents (sentences) or doc._.textrank.paragraphs could help. But paragraph or section level is a good granularity for alignment.)
Aligning and Cross-Pollinating Text Data
Once you have the textual data from both domains, the key step is aligning related content between the two domains and injecting cross-domain context. Cross-pollination here means linking concepts from one domain’s text with another’s to create training pairs or combined examples. There are a few strategies to achieve this:
Identify overlapping entities or topics: Scan the math text for key terms (e.g., people, dates, famous concepts) that might also appear in the history text. For instance, a math textbook might mention “Newton” (as in Newton’s method or calculus); a history textbook might discuss Isaac Newton in the context of the Scientific Revolution. Using spaCy’s named entity recognition (NER) can help extract proper nouns and technical terms. For example:
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc_math = nlp(math_sections[0])
ents = [ent.text for ent in doc_math.ents]
print(ents)
# e.g., output might include ["Newton", "17th century", "Europe"]
If "Newton" appears, you can search the history text for that word and pull the surrounding sentence or paragraph. Even without exact matches, look for related terms (maybe the history text says “Isaac Newton” fully – you could do case-insensitive search or use fuzzy matching). These overlapping entities serve as natural anchors to connect content from both domains.
Use semantic similarity to find analogues: Even when specific words don’t match, you can find conceptually similar passages. NLP embedding techniques help here:
Compute vector embeddings for each section of math text and each section of history text (using, say, a sentence transformer or even a simple TF-IDF vector). Then, for each math section, find the nearest-neighbor section from history by cosine similarity. For example, a math section about exponential growth might align with a history section about rapid population growth.
Code example: Using scikit-learn’s TF-IDF to match a math paragraph with a history paragraph:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
# Combine sections for a joint vector space
all_sections = math_sections + history_sections
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer().fit(all_sections)
tfidf_all = vectorizer.transform(all_sections)
math_vecs = tfidf_all[:len(math_sections)]
history_vecs = tfidf_all[len(math_sections):]
# Find best match for first math section
import numpy as np
sim_scores = (history_vecs * math_vecs[0].T).toarray().ravel()
best_idx = np.argmax(sim_scores)
print("Best matching history section:", history_sections[best_idx][:200], "...")
This finds the history section with the highest cosine similarity to the first math section. In practice, you’d do this for each math section (and maybe vice-versa) and pair them up if the similarity is above a certain threshold.
Alternatively, use pre-trained models: Hugging Face’s Transformers (e.g., Sentence-BERT models) can produce embeddings that might capture deeper semantic links than TF-IDF. This requires more setup but can be more powerful for abstract connections (like linking a math concept of “networks” with a historical concept of “trade networks”).
Manual or rule-based topic linking: If you have domain expertise, you might manually define some cross-domain links. For example, list major concepts in math (calculus, geometry, statistics) and see if the history text covers related events (history of calculus, use of geometry in architecture, statistical methods in census, etc.). Then create combined text or Q&A pairs around those. This can ensure highly meaningful pairings, though it’s labor-intensive.
Create synthetic cross-domain examples: To really teach the model to recombine knowledge, consider writing some prompts that explicitly mix domains, and then use the textbooks to fill in content. For instance: “Explain [math concept] in the context of [historical event]” – then answer it by pulling explanatory text from the math book and historical context from the history book, melding them into one coherent piece. This could be semi-automated: you detect a math concept and a fitting historical analogy, then use the source texts to compose an answer. (You might even use an LLM to draft the bridging sentences, ensuring the info from textbooks is included.)
Why align at all? We want the LLM to not just separately know math and history, but to see them side-by-side. By aligning related pieces, we expose the model to the relationships between domains. This is akin to how analogies work in human learning – mapping a familiar domain to a new one can illuminate hidden connections. For example, “utilizing the analogy of the solar system can facilitate comprehension of the complex structure of atoms”​
aclanthology.org
 – similarly, an analogy between a historical empire’s expansion and an exponential function’s growth curve can spark insight. These aligned examples will encourage the model to form internal weight patterns that connect the two domains.
Best Practices for Meaningful Cross-Domain Linkages
When building a diversified, cross-pollinated dataset, keep these guidelines in mind to ensure the linkages are effective and not just noise:
Maintain context clarity: If you combine text from two sources in one training example, provide cues so the model isn’t confused. You might introduce a combined passage with a sentence like, “Mathematically, this concept is described as... Historically, we saw a parallel in...” This way, the model knows the switch of context. Alternatively, keep them as separate consecutive samples but still ensure the content is thematically linked.
Quality over randomness: Don’t force connections that don’t make sense. It’s better to have a few strong cross-domain links (where the analogy or relationship is clear) than many disjointed juxtapositions. The model learns better from meaningful examples. Ensure that any historical text you pair with math text truly relates (by theme, by an underlying principle, or by a common entity).
Balance both domains: One domain’s content should not completely overshadow the other. Aim for a roughly balanced representation of math and history in the final dataset (unless you intend to weight one more). If your math textbook is much longer than the history one, you might reuse some history sections in multiple pairings or supplement with additional history sources so the model gets equal exposure.
Preserve factual accuracy: When blending information, be careful not to distort facts. It’s easy to create a misleading analogy. For instance, comparing something in history to a math concept is great for insight, but ensure the model also sees the literal truth in each domain. You don’t want the model to think a historical event literally is a mathematical function. Clarify what is analogy or metaphor.
Include standalone domain data too: In addition to cross-linked examples, include some pure math and pure history data in the mix. This ensures the model still learns each subject independently and doesn’t always expect a connection. The pure domain data cements the core knowledge, while the mixed data teaches the model how to bridge them.
Use metadata or separators if needed: If formatting as an instruction dataset, you could label parts of the input (e.g., [Math] ... [History] ...). However, in plain SFT text, it might be better to let the text flow naturally. Another approach is formatting some data as dialogues: e.g., a conversation between a mathematician and a historian discussing a topic. This can explicitly demonstrate cross-domain discourse. (This approach is inspired by multi-perspective data generation methods; for example, CulturePark simulated dialogues between agents of different cultures to teach models cross-cultural understanding​
arxiv.org
. By analogy, you could simulate discussions between different domain experts.)
Diverse genres and styles: Remember that even within a domain, textbooks have a certain style (expository, didactic). It might help to sprinkle in other genres for variety – maybe a bit of historical narrative text and a bit of mathematical biography or philosophy of mathematics. This variety can prevent the model from overfitting to a single tone and encourages flexibility in recombining knowledge.
By following these practices, you ensure the dataset is not just diverse, but cohesive in its diversity, providing clear signals to the model about how knowledge from different fields interrelates.
Automating Dataset Creation with NLP Libraries
We can leverage NLP libraries like Hugging Face’s ecosystem and spaCy to streamline the creation of our multi-domain dataset. Below is a high-level pipeline with code sketches:1. Text Extraction and Preprocessing – as covered above. (Code provided in previous sections for PDF extraction and OCR.)After extraction, assume we have two lists: math_sections and history_sections (each a list of paragraph or section strings).2. Finding Candidate Linkages (automated alignment):
# Using spaCy to get key terms from math and history
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
math_key_terms = set()
for section in math_sections:
    doc = nlp(section)
    for ent in doc.ents:
        # Collect proper nouns or unique terms (could also collect frequent nouns)
        if ent.label_ in ["PERSON", "ORG", "GPE", "EVENT", "WORK_OF_ART"]:
            math_key_terms.add(ent.text)

# Find matching sections in history by these key terms
linked_pairs = []
for term in math_key_terms:
    for h_sec in history_sections:
        if term in h_sec:
            # find any math sections containing the term too
            for m_sec in math_sections:
                if term in m_sec:
                    linked_pairs.append((m_sec, h_sec, term))
This simple loop finds sections from both texts that share a named entity (e.g., a person or location). The resulting linked_pairs is a list of tuples: (math_section, history_section, linking_term). You could refine this by ensuring the sections actually discuss the term in depth, or by limiting each pair to unique matches.3. Semantic Matching via Embeddings:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.8, stop_words='english')
all_secs = math_sections + history_sections
tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(all_secs)
math_vecs = tfidf[:len(math_sections)]
hist_vecs = tfidf[len(math_sections):]

# For each math section, find top-N similar history sections
N = 1  # or 3 for multiple
for i, m_vec in enumerate(math_vecs):
    cos_sim = (hist_vecs * m_vec.T).toarray().flatten()
    top_idx = np.argsort(cos_sim)[-N:]
    for j in top_idx:
        sim_score = cos_sim[j]
        if sim_score < 0.1:
            continue  # skip very low similarities
        linked_pairs.append((math_sections[i], history_sections[j], f"sim={sim_score:.2f}"))
Here we use TF-IDF for simplicity. In practice, you could replace this with a transformer-based embedder for better results. We gather any pairs above a similarity threshold. Each pair is tagged with a similarity score for reference.4. Constructing the Dataset Entries:Now that we have cross-domain section pairs, decide how to format them in the SFT dataset. There are a few formats to consider:
As combined expository text: Merge the two sections into one piece of text, perhaps with a transitional sentence. For example:
combined_text = (f"In mathematics: {m_sec}\n\n"
                 f"In history: {h_sec}")
Or write a one-liner like "The concept above is echoed in history: ...". These combined texts can be fed as standalone training documents (the model will learn to continue text that flows from math to history).
As QA or instruction pairs: You can create a prompt like "Q: How does [term/concept] relate between math and history?\nA: ..." and then use the content in m_sec and h_sec to form the answer. This way, the model is explicitly trained to produce a cross-domain explanation. For example:
prompt = f"Explain the significance of '{term}' in both mathematics and history."
answer = m_sec + " Similarly, " + h_sec
qa_pair = {"instruction": prompt, "response": answer}
This fits an instruction-tuning format (if your SFT is instruction based). The term here is the linking term or concept.
As dialogue: Format the text as a conversation between two speakers (Mathematician and Historian) where each section is spoken by one. E.g., Mathematician: <math_section>; Historian: <history_section>. This can teach the model to chat about cross-domain topics.
For the sake of illustration, let’s assume we go with a simple combined text format. We’ll compile a list of dataset samples:
dataset_entries = []
for (m_sec, h_sec, link) in linked_pairs:
    combined = f"{m_sec}\n\n{h_sec}"
    dataset_entries.append(combined)
# Also add some standalone entries (optional)
dataset_entries.extend(math_sections)
dataset_entries.extend(history_sections)
Now dataset_entries contains a mix of combined and single-domain texts. We should shuffle them so the training sees a random ordering:
import random
random.shuffle(dataset_entries)
5. Creating a Hugging Face Dataset (optional): If you want to use the Hugging Face datasets library to manage and save this dataset:
from datasets import Dataset
dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"text": dataset_entries})
print(dataset[:3]["text"])  # preview 3 entries
dataset.push_to_hub("my-llm-math-history-sft")  # if you want to share it
(Make sure you have Hugging Face Hub authentication set up if pushing to hub.)Now you have a structured dataset ready for fine-tuning. Each entry in dataset_entries can be treated as a training sample for the LLM. If you prefer an instruction format, you would structure each as a dict with "prompt" and "completion" or similar fields and perhaps use Dataset.from_list with those dicts.
Structuring the Dataset for Knowledge Recombination
How you structure and present the data to the LLM during fine-tuning can influence its ability to recombine knowledge creatively:
Intermix domains during training: Don’t segregate all math first then history; shuffle or alternate them. This prevents the model from partitioning its weights strictly by order of exposure. By seeing a history example, then a math example, then a combined example, etc., the model’s layers continuously adjust to handle diverse inputs.
Include cross-domain context within the context window: Some training samples (as we created) should contain both domains in one sequence. This directly trains the attention mechanism to attend to, say, a math concept and a history concept simultaneously, forming internal links. Over time, the model will encode these associations in its weights.
Leverage analogies and metaphors: As a special type of data, you can feed the model explicit analogies. For example: “Just as the Roman Empire expanded and then fell, an overfit model performs well on training data but fails on new data,” if we were mixing history and ML. Such analogical sentences force the model to map structure from one domain to another. The analogies paper cited earlier shows how analogies help transfer knowledge​
aclanthology.org
. In our case, well-crafted cross-domain analogies in the dataset can guide the model to make its own analogical leaps in the future.
Epistemological notes: Since the goal is to teach the model how knowledge is formed, consider adding text that reflects on knowledge formation. For instance, a preface from a history book about historical methodology alongside a preface from a math book about the philosophy of mathematics. By reading both, the model might abstract the idea of how different fields develop and validate knowledge. These higher-level insights can become the glue that the model uses to connect facts creatively.
Size and variety: Use as many high-quality examples as feasible. Each textbook could yield thousands of paragraphs. If you combine two textbooks and create cross-links, you might end up with, say, 5,000–10,000 training samples. More is generally better for covering varied ways the domains can interact. Ensure that for every major topic in one domain, you have at least one link to the other domain (even if tenuous), so the model sees a broad coverage of intersections.
Finally, keep an eye on evaluation: after fine-tuning, test the model with some prompts that require cross-domain reasoning (e.g., “Draw an analogy between a concept in calculus and an event in world history.”). If the model was trained on a well-structured diversified dataset, it should produce insightful, linked answers – demonstrating that it has learned an underlying epistemology of how knowledge from different fields can be combined to yield new perspectives.
Conclusion
By following this guide, you can curate a supervised fine-tuning dataset that bridges mathematics, history, and potentially other domains. The process involves extracting text from sources, aligning the content through common threads or semantic similarity, and carefully structuring the combined data. The resulting multi-genre dataset will encourage your LLM to develop rich internal representations that connect concepts across domains. As literature on LLM training suggests, mixing diverse high-quality data improves general knowledge​
ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org
 – here, we push that idea further by not only mixing domains but explicitly linking them.Through thoughtful pairing of textbook passages and possibly instruction-style prompts that span domains, the model gains practice in recombining knowledge. Over time, this can enable analogical reasoning and creative problem-solving, as the LLM learns to see, for example, how a principle in one field might inform an idea in another. The goal is an AI that doesn’t just memorize facts in silos, but understands the tapestry of human knowledge – how ideas from different disciplines weave together.With a diversified, cross-pollinated training set, you are effectively teaching the LLM a mini-course in interdisciplinary thinking. This foundation can lead to more novel insights and robust reasoning in responses, as the model draws from a wider pool of concepts and perspectives when addressing new queries. Good luck with your dataset creation, and enjoy the discoveries that emerge from bridging worlds within your LLM!Sources:
